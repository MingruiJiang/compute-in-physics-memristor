# Compute-in-Physics with Memristor Dynamic Systems for Scalable Combinatorial Optimization

This repository contains the simulation code and implementation for the research paper: **"Compute-in-physics with a memristor dynamic system for scalable combinatorial optimization"**.

## Overview

This work demonstrates a novel approach to solving combinatorial optimization problems using memristor-based dynamic systems. The implementation leverages the physical dynamics of memristor networks to perform Ising model computations, enabling efficient solutions to NP-hard problems like the MaxCut problem through analog computing principles.
